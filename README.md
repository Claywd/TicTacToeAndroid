CSCE Project 3

This is essentially the game TicTacToe made for android but mostly programmed in C++. Using the highly experimental NDK wrapper, William Lamb and Zachariah Stratton programmed their respective functions in C++ and then those functions were integrated into the GUI prgrammed by me. 

William Lamb - A*
Clayton Dittman- GUI
Zachariah Stratton- MiniMax
